Qianwen (Vivian) Guo is an assistant professor in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, where she advances equitable and resilient transportation systems. Her research examines how public transit, shared mobility, and infrastructure investments can improve access to opportunity and critical services for underserved communities.

She leads projects that translate large-scale mobility data and network models into actionable recommendations for planners responding to rapid urbanization, extreme weather, and infrastructure disruptions. At the Resilient Infrastructure & Disaster Response Center, she collaborates with public agencies to evaluate vulnerability across multimodal systems and identify strategies that enhance community preparedness.

Guo holds dual doctoral training in civil engineering and management science and engineering, along with graduate and undergraduate degrees in transportation engineering. This interdisciplinary foundation supports her ongoing work to connect transit resilience with public policy and on-the-ground implementation.
