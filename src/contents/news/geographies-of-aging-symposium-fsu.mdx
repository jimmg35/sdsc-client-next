# 2026 Geographies of Aging and the Life Course (GOAL) Symposium at FSU

SDSC faculty Dr.DeJohn is helping to launch the first **Geographies of Aging and the Life Course Symposium** at Florida State Universityâ€”an initiative that brings together scholars focused on aging, mobility, and community well-being.

The 2026 GOAL Symposium, hosted by Florida State University, marks the first independent meeting of GOAL researchers. This 2-day workshop will build capacity for geographies of aging and the life course through keynote speakers, methodological workshops, and opportunities to share work in progress.

Mark your calendars for February 26-27th, 2026 in Tallahassee, Florida!
